# Project-Python

A curated portfolio of Python-based projects focused on CLI tools, data analytics, data cleaning, log processing, API integration, and modular software design.

## Featured Projects

### [TaskFlow Engine](./taskflow-engine)
A clean, modular, and extensible command-line task manager built with Python, OOP principles, and SQLite persistence.

### [DataInsight Engine](./datainsight-engine)
A professional CLI data analytics engine that provides product insights, order analysis, and revenue calculations using SQLite.

### [DataClean Pro](./dataclean-pro)
A lightweight data-cleaning and validation engine that processes CSV files, detects invalid values, converts data types, and generates detailed error reports.

### [LogAnalyzer Pro](./loganalyzer-pro)
A modular log analysis engine that parses log files, extracts structured information, identifies errors and warnings, and generates clean summary reports.

### [API Fetcher Tool](./api-fetcher-tool)
A flexible and modular CLI tool for fetching data from public APIs, validating responses, handling errors, and generating structured JSON and text reports.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python 3 (OOP, modular design)
- CLI development
- Data validation & cleaning
- SQLite integration

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized as an independent module with:
- `src/` for source code  
- `data/`, `logs/`, or `config/` for input files  
- `output/` for generated reports  
- `README.md` for documentation
