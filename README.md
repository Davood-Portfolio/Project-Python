## 📘 Exercism Python Solutions (`solutions/python`)

This section contains my solved Python exercises from the **Exercism** learning platform.  
These challenges demonstrate clean, idiomatic Python code and consistent practice with problem‑solving and test‑driven development.

### Includes:
- Multiple small, focused Python exercises  
- Automated tests provided by Exercism  
- Iterative improvements synced automatically  
- Clean and readable implementations  

### Example Exercises:
- **Hello World** — basic syntax and test structure  
- **Guido’s Gorgeous Lasagna** — functions and constants
